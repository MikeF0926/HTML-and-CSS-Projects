            <h2>This is my div header</h2>
            <p>Whatever I write inside of this paragraph, which is contained inside of a "div" will make the color royal blue. It actually changed when I added css and it overtook what was in the div and made the colors purple.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="color: olivedrab;">
            <h2>This is another header</h2>
            <p>This is a color I found on here called "olivedrab," pretty neat name.</p>
