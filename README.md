# HTML and CSS Projects

I had various assignments when I first begin learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap we then begin creating projects utilizing the skills learned.

#### Dog Resort

I made a website for a dog check-in resort and included images using HTML, and CSS to add style. This was my first time getting to create a navigation bar that was linked to sections of the webpage.

#### Batman Trilogy

I created this website using Bootstrap5 and was able to include showtimes and buttons for one of my favorite trilogies. I included a navbar, along with cards and forms. It also includes a sign-up for more information inside the webpage.

#### About Me/Contact Me

This was one of my final projects for using HTML and CSS where I was to make a page about myself and actually have a working contact form. I used formspree, which I linked with my live e-mail address.
