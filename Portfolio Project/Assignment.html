        <p> Here is a quote from American Kennel Club about German Shepherd's:</p>
        
        <blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog/">
        German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, 
        when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles.
        The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.
